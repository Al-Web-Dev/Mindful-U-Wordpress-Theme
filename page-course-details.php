        <h2>Free Orientation Session</h2>
        <p>This is a one to one session to discuss over the phone, Skype or face to face the suitability of the course for yourself and to answer any questions about the course you may have.</p>  

        <h2>Eight 2 Hours Classes</h2>
        <p>During the period of the 8 weeks, we will meet in group each week for 2-hour sessions. These sessions will encompass the different mindfulness practice awareness of breathing, awareness of body sensation, gentle yoga/mindful movement... But also dictatorial teaching, teacher to student inquiry and group sharing.</p>

        <h2>1 Day Retreat</h2>
        <p>The day retreat will happen on the weekend after the 6th week of the course. It will look like a typical 2-hour session but will last longer from 10am to 4pm. This is a great opportunity to the practice for a longer stretch of time and go a little bit deeper.</p>

        <h2>30-45min Daily Practice</h2>
        <p>You donâ€™t learn how to play tennis by simply watching a tennis game. The same applies for mindfulness, you might get a feel for what it is, by reading and listening about it, but only a regular and committed practice will bring you its benefits.</p>

        <h2>The attitudes underlying the course</h2>
        <p>You may have gathered that this course is about giving an opportunity to the participants to put in place and nurture a regular mindfulness practice in order to develop a more meaningful and happier life.

		However this course could not be successful without healthy foundations. These, are referred to as the 7 attitudinal foundations: Non-judgmental, Patience, Non-striving, Beginners mind, Trust, Acceptance and Letting go. Theses attitudinal foundations are the fertile soil to grow more mindful and happier but will also continuously grow as our practice develop.</p>
